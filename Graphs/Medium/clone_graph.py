# Clone Graph

# Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph. Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
# Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
    # class Node {
    #     public int val;
    #     public List<Node> neighbors;
    # }
 
# Test case format:
# For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. 
# The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
# An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
# The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
